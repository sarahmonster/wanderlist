# wanderlist

Wanderlist is a WordPress plugin for travellers and nomads, to help you track & display your travels.

## Getting started

Install the plugin by uploading it to your plugins directory (usually `wp-content/plugins`). Activate it, and you should be ready to roll!

### Getting a Mapbox API key

Wanderlist uses Mapbox to serve beautiful, easily-to-customize maps. In order to use it, you'll need to sign up for a free Mapbox account.

First, you'll need to [sign up for a free Mapbox account](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/)

Once that's all taken care of, navigate to [Account â†’ Apps](https://www.mapbox.com/account/apps/) to generate a new API key. Make sure to choose a **public** key and give it a memorable name. Your new API key should look something like this:

pk.xX13xX7332b2389csa6ST23uhgwq7iuhdasy1276

Copy everything after the "pk" (if you use Mapbox's automatic "copy to clipboard" button) and enter the number into your settings page.

### Setting up your settings

Wanderlist has only a few basic options for now, but you'll want to set them up before you get rolling.

The first thing you'll want to do is set your "home" location.
